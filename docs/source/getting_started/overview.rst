*JupyterLab is the next generation user interface for Project Jupyter*

JupyterLab goes beyond the classic Jupyter Notebook by providing a
flexible and extensible web application with a set of reusable
components. You can arrange multiple notebooks, text editors, terminals,
output areas, and custom components using tabs/panels and collapsible
sidebars. These components are carefully designed to enable you to use
them together or on their own to support new workflows (for example, you
can send code from a file to a code console with a keystroke, or move
cells around a notebook or between notebooks with drag-and-drop).

**JupyterLab has full support for Jupyter Notebook documents.** In
addition, it enables other models of interactive computing, such as:

-  :ref:`code-consoles` provide transient scratchpads for running code
   interactively, with full support for rich output.
-  :ref:`Kernel-backed documents <kernel-backed-documents>` allow code in any text file (Markdown,
   Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter
   kernel.

JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data
formats. This allows data in many formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown,
PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) to be opened as a file or returned by a
kernel as rich output. See :ref:`file-and-output-formats` for more
information.

JupyterLab is served from the same
`server <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ and uses
the same `notebook document
format <http://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ as the classic
Jupyter Notebook.
