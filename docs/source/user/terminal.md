# Terminals

JupyterLab Terminals provide full support for system shells (bash, tsch, etc.)
on Mac/Linux and Command.exe on Windows. With the Terminal, you can run anything
in your system shell, including programs such as vim or emacs. The Terminals run
on the system where the Jupyter server is running, with the permissions of your
user. Thus, if JupyterLab is installed on your local machine, the JupyterLab
terminals will run there.
