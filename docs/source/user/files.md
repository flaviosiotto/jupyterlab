## Overview

The File Browser and File menu allow you to work with files and directories on
your system. This includes opening, creating, deleting, renaming, downloading,
copying and sharing files and directories.

The File Browser is in the Left Panel (the Files tab):

Many files types have multiple viewers/editors. For example, you can open a
markdown file in the text editor, or as rendered markdown. To open a file in a
non-default viewer/editor, right-click on its name in the File Browser, and use
the "Open With..." submenu to select the viewer/editor:

A single file can be open simultaneously in multiple viewer/editors and they
will remain in sync:

The file system can be navigated by double clicking on folders, or on the
directories at the top of the directory listing:

Each file or directory in JupyterLab also has a URL that can used to open
JupyterLab with that file or directory open. To get the shareable link,
right-click on the file or directory and select the "Copy Shareable Link" item:
