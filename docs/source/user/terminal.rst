Terminals
---------

JupyterLab terminals provide full support for system shells (bash, tsch,
etc.) on Mac/Linux and PowerShell on Windows. You can run anything in
your system shell with a terminal, including programs such as vim or
emacs. The terminals run on the system where the Jupyter server is
running, with the privileges of your user. Thus, if JupyterLab is
installed on your local machine, the JupyterLab terminals will run
there.
