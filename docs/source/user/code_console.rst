Code Consoles
-------------

Code consoles allow you to run code interactively in a kernel. The cells
of a code console show the order in which code was executed in the
kernel, as opposed to the explicit ordering of cells in a notebook
document. Code consoles also display rich output, just like notebook
cells.

Create a new code console by clicking the ``+`` button in the file
browser and selecting the kernel:

Run code using ``Shift Enter``. Use the up and down arrows to browse the
history of previously-run code:

Tab completion (``Tab``) and tooltips (``Shift Tab``) work as in the
notebook:

Clear the cells of the code console without restarting the kernel by
right-clicking on the code console and selecting “Clear Console Cells”:

Creating a code console from the File menu lets you select an existing
kernel for the code console. The code console then acts as a log of
computations in that kernel, and a place you can interactively inspect
and run code in the kernel:
